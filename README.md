# Airbnb Hong Kong 

In this project, I used a Hong Kong Airbnb dataset which was downloaded from Inside Airbnb (insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). This dataset provides a view on the Airbnb listings in Hong Kong and the potential business opportunities.

## Features
1. Queries: Useful queries are available to users on the number of listings in different neighbourhoods, the total revenue from listings regarding neighbourhood, price and rating from the reviewer. 
2. Views: Views on price and quality of listings and blacklist of listings which need improvement. 

## Getting started
1.	Create Database: Execute the SQL script to create all tables.
